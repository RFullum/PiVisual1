FFT Spectrum Visualizer with Bouncing Balls

Audio Visualizer: Uses FFT analysis to agitate bouncing balls across the spectrum.
Balls will grow in size and move faster based on the amplitude of their 
corresponding FFT band. Balls will bounce off other balls and screen edge,
scattering across screen as amplitude causes more collisions
